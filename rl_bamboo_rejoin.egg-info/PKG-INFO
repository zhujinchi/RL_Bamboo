# BambooMatching

A Game-Theoretic Reinforcement Learning Framework for Ancient Bamboo Slip Fragment Matching

## Overview

BambooMatching is a Python library that implements a novel approach to the challenging problem of matching ancient bamboo slip fragments. By combining Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning with Bayesian game theory, the framework dramatically improves the matching accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Ancient bamboo slips were the primary writing medium in East Asia for over a millennium, containing invaluable historical records. However, they are typically unearthed as thousands of fragmented pieces. This project addresses the critical challenge of efficiently rejoining these fragments to recover their cultural and historical content.

## Key Features

- **Expert Feature Integration**: Effectively leverages expert-annotated fragment features without requiring paired training examples
- **Game-Theoretic Modeling**: Models fragments as strategic agents in an asymmetric information game
- **Adaptive Strategy Selection**: Dynamically selects between conservative and aggressive matching strategies based on competitive context
- **Non-Intrusive Integration**: Seamlessly enhances existing professional bamboo slip rejoining tools
- **Continuous Improvement**: Learns from human expert decisions to create a virtuous cycle of improvement

## Installation

```bash
pip install bamboo-matching
```

## Quick Start

```python
import numpy as np
from rl_bamboo_rejoin import (
    Fragment, load_fragments_from_csv, FragmentMatchingEnv, 
    SACAgent, visualize_training
)

# Load or generate fragment data
fragments_bottom, fragments_top = load_fragments_from_csv('fragments_data.csv')

# Create distance matrix (or load existing one)
dis_map = np.load('distance_matrix.npy')

# Create environment with game theory enhancement
env = FragmentMatchingEnv(
    fragments_top=fragments_top,
    fragments_bottom=fragments_bottom,
    dis_map=dis_map,
    alpha=0.5,
    use_game_theory=True
)

# Initialize state dimensions
state = env.reset()
state_dim = len(state)
action_dim = 5  # 4 weights + 1 scaling factor

# Create SAC agent
agent = SACAgent(state_dim, action_dim)

# Train the agent (simplified)
rewards = []
for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    episode_reward = 0
    done = False
    
    while not done:
        action = agent.select_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        
        # Update the agent
        agent.update(...)  # Simplified
        
        state = next_state
        episode_reward += reward
    
    rewards.append(episode_reward)
    print(f"Episode {episode}, Reward: {episode_reward:.2f}")

# Visualize results
visualize_training(rewards, [], [])
```

## Components
